Yes, it is possible to create a script in Roblox that allows for a keyboard button to be used on mobile devices. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

1. First, create a script in a LocalScript object in Roblox Studio and place it in a StarterPlayerScripts or StarterCharacterScripts folder.

2. Inside the script, add the following code:

```lua
-- Check if the device is a mobile device
local userInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")
local isMobile = userInputService.TouchEnabled

-- Create a GUI button for the keyboard button
local button = Instance.new("TextButton")
button.Position = UDim2.new(0, 100, 0, 100) -- Set the position of the button
button.Size = UDim2.new(0, 100, 0, 50) -- Set the size of the button
button.Text = "Keyboard Button" -- Set the text on the button

-- Function to trigger the button press
local function onKeyDown(keyCode)
    if keyCode == Enum.KeyCode.B then -- Replace B with the desired key
        -- Replace this block with the actions you want to occur when the button is pressed
        print("Button pressed!")
    end
end

-- Connect the button press function to the button's MouseButton1Down event
button.MouseButton1Down:Connect(function()
    onKeyDown(Enum.KeyCode.B)
end)

-- Add the button to the PlayerGui if the device is a mobile device
local playerGui = game.Players.LocalPlayer:WaitForChild("PlayerGui")
if isMobile then
    button.Parent = playerGui
end
```

3. Customize the code to fit your needs. You can change the position, size, and text of the button by modifying the relevant properties in the script.

4. Replace the block inside the `onKeyDown` function with the actions you want to occur when the button is pressed. In the provided example, it simply prints a message to the output.

5. Lastly, make sure to replace the `Enum.KeyCode.B` with the desired keyboard button you want to map to the mobile button. You can find a list of supported keyboard buttons in the Roblox API documentation.

Once you have added this script to your game, Roblox Studio will automatically upload and run it when you test your game on a mobile device. You should be able to see and interact with the keyboard button on the screen and trigger the assigned actions when pressed.
